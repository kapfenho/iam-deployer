* Weblogic user permission problem after install:
    You need to add permissions to the new weblogic admin user (in directory).
    solution:
      1. in OIM create new role 'Administrators Ext' (in Top organization)
      2. add the existing admin role to the new role.
           in other words:
            (=> inherit from extistin admin role to new admin role)
            (=> this means the new admin role has all priviledges of the existing role)
      3. add the WebLogic admin (directory) to the new role

* Check if rc.d files are in place

* Provisioning
