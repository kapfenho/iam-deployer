* Weblogic user permission problem after install:
    You need to add permissions to the new weblogic admin user (in directory).
    solution:
      1. in OIM create new role 'Administrators Ext' (in Top organization)
      2. add the existing admin role to the new role.
           in other words:
            (=> inherit from extistin admin role to new admin role)
            (=> this means the new admin role has all priviledges of the existing role)
      3. add the WebLogic admin (directory) to the new role

* separate system parameters by application (database machine, app server, etc.)
